</br>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">Design plays an essential role in communicating between objects and users. Any device should be intuitive and easy to use. That being said, some  give the user tough time to figure out how they work. In this project, we will look into  a microwave,  an ubiquitous device we see everyday, to see its current design and how we can make it becomes more user-friendly.

I bought a microwave from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GV36BLD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Amazon</a>. It's a COMFEE's countertop microwave, first released in 2018.  Here is a photo of the microwave, with the control interface on the right.

 Here is the photo of the microwave, the control interface is on the right.

Show a gif image of the control interface in operation.

Find the issues with the current design and explain why it is bad.
-Too many buttons, most of them are rarely used
-Buttons are not tactile
- It takes many steps if the user want to set the power level





To get a B, you need to:
List your most common uses and other more rare uses of a microwave. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
- Common uses:
  Express warmup: 1 minutes, 1 and a half minutes, 2 minutes
  Sometimes need to adjust the power level
- Rerely uses:
  Other buttons like defrost, berevage, vegetables,...

Think about how the user interacts with the microwave. What is the common sequence of actions?
time ro start (express)


How does the microwave support the user figure out how to make it work?
button: express start

How does the microwave provide feedback to the user?
sounds + digital screen

What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
Hard to figure out how to set up the power level, not sure which level is max/min.
After the power level is set, how to see it later on.

Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution and justify your design decisions.
My suggestion: 
The key features: should focus on time and power level. It should easy to see these 2 features, and require minimum steps to proceed.
- Make the power level more visiable with a knob, its values are ranging  from 1 (less power) to 10 (most power).
The user can easy adust the power level and can see what level they are using easily.
- For warmup time, using "adding" rather than "setting". When pressing a button, it should "add" that amount of time to the current time left. For example, pressing on "+6" twice, it should give us "12" minutes. It can also be archived by other combination, such as "+7" and "+5", as long as they add up to "12". By doing this, we do not need to go through so many steps to set up the time as before (pressing "Time", "1", "2", "0", "0" to set 12 minutes.)
- Some other suggestions would be elaborated in the next section.
My sketch:

It would be more elegant if the microwave has the touch screen. However, is this project, we just want to keep it as simple as possible. On top of that, the primary features are good without the help of the touch screen. Thus, we dicide to use a small digital screen only, for the purpose of display the heating time.

Come up with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?
Design and implement interactive features
Design and implement user feedback
You use Processing for this project. -->
