<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">1. Motivation</h2>

</br>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:
      justify;">Design plays an essential role in communicating between objects and users. Any device should be intuitive and easy to use. That being said, some give the user a tough time figuring out how they work. In this project, we will look into the microwave, a ubiquitous device we see every day, to see its current design and make it more user-friendly.

<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">2. Current Desgin</h2>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">
I bought a new microwave from Amazon a few months ago. It was a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GV36BLD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1">COMFEE's countertop microwave</a>, first released in 2018.  Here is a photo of the microwave with the control interface on the right.

</br></br>

<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">3. Key Features</h2>

To see if the interface makes doing those common things easier,  first, we need to identify common uses and rare uses of a microwave. 
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">

 Common use: 
</p>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
  <li> Express cooking: For example, pressing on "1" to heat the food up in 1 minute.
      </br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaupmcs/p1.ChauPham/main/pictures/quick_run.gif" alt="" border="0" width="1000">

</li>
</br>
  <li> Set up both time cook and power level: Let's say we want to heat the food up in 1 minute with 80% power: either using a combination of "Time", 0", "1", "0", "0", "Power", "8", "start" or using express cook by pressing "1", and then changing the power level while heating up using "power", "8".
  </br>

</li>

</ul>
</br>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">

Rare uses: Other buttons like defrost, beverage, vegetables
</p>

</br></br>


<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">4. Potential Issues</h2>


<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">
What are the potential issues with this design?

<ul style="padding-left:40px">
  <li> Too many buttons, most of them are rarely used
</li>
  <li> Buttons are not tactile
</li>
  <li> It takes many steps to set the power level, not to mention that the power setting is not intuitive as the user needs to choose the time cook first.
</li>
</ul>

</p> 


</br>


<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">

The microwave supports the user figure out by some user instructions on the keypad. It provides feedback to the user using sounds and the LED screen.

</p> 
</br>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">

This current design may cause some trouble for the user, such as  it is hard to figure out how to set up the power level and not sure which level is the max/min.
Besides, quite many steps for setting up the power level.
</p> 
</br>
</br>


<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">5. Suggestions</h2>


<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">
It should easy to see these two primary features (Time Cook, Power Level) and require minimum steps to proceed.
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
  <li> Make the power level more visible with a knob. Its values are ranging from 1 (least power) to 10 (most power). The user can easily adjust the power level and can see what level they are using easily.
</li>
  <li> For time cook, using "adding" rather than "setting". It will "add" an amount of time to the current time left when a button is pressed. For example, pressing on "+6" twice will give us 12 minutes. It can also be archived by other combinations, such as "+7" and "+5", as long as they add up to 12. By doing this, we do not need to go through so many steps to set up the time as before (i.e., "Time", "1", "2", "0", "0", "START").

</li>

 <li> Some other suggestions would be elaborated in the next section.


</li>

</ul>

<h2> Demo </h2>


<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">
In this project, we use <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> to demonstrate the new design.
</br>

In addition to nine number buttons ("+1" to "+9"), the microwave has a "STOP" button and a "+30s" button.
To start, the user can press any "+" button. It will add that amount of time to the current time and start the microwave if it is not running.
There is also a knob to control the power level. The brightness of the microwave is proportional to the power level.


<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; text-align:justify;">

It would be more elegant if the microwave has a touch screen. However, in this design, we want to keep it as simple as possible, as long as it is straightforward and user-friendly. On top of that, the primary features are well explained without the fancy touch screen's help. Thus, we decide to use a simple LED screen only for displaying the time cook.
</p> 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaupmcs/p1.ChauPham/main/pictures/my_demo.png" alt="" border="0" width="1000">

</br>
User Feedback in the new design.
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
  <li> Sound when pressing on the button
</li>
  <li> The button is highlighted when pressed.

</li>

 <li> The higher the power level, the brighter (more yellow) the microwave is 
</li>

 <li> Sound when the heating is finished
</li>
</ul>

This new design can help the user avoid abundant steps and focus on the microwave's key features. The knob with some instruction text ("+" and "10" for max, "-" and "1" for min) is intuitive to adjust the power level. The user can adjust both power level and time cook easier and faster. We believe that it is a more user-friendly design for the microwave.
